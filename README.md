# Interpretable-Deep-Learning-for-Automated-Lung-Disease-Detection
This project applies deep learning techniques to automate the detection of lung diseases from chest X-ray images. The focus is not only on model performance but also on interpretability â€” helping medical professionals understand what the model is seeing.
